# Text Analysis and NLP Tutorials [ _Materials will be uploaded_]

# Overview
This repository provides step-by-step tutorials on Text Analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is designed to guide learners and practitioners from foundational concepts to advanced techniques like transformer-based models. Each tutorial includes power point slides, code examples, and practical applications.

## Tutorials Included

- Bag of Words 
- Vectorization 


# 2. Keyword Extraction
- Extract key phrases or words that summarize a document.
- TF-IDF (Term Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency)
- RAKE (Rapid Automatic Keyword Extraction)

# 3. Text Classification with Traditional ML
- Build simple classification models for tasks like spam detection or text categorization.
- Vectorizing text data using Bag-of-Words and TF-IDF
- Training classifiers such as Logistic Regression and Naive Bayes
- Evaluating model performance

# 4. Sentiment Analysis
- Lexicon-Based Methods: Using sentiment dictionaries like VADER and SentiWordNet.
- Machine Learning-Based Models: Training classifiers using labeled sentiment datasets.
- Transformer-Based Methods: Fine-tuning models like BERT for advanced sentiment prediction.

# 5. Word Embeddings and Text Similarity
- Understand word embeddings and their applications: Learn about Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText.
- Use embeddings to calculate text similarity using cosine similarity.
- Applications include document matching, plagiarism detection, and recommendation systems.

# 6. Topic Modeling
- Discover hidden topics in large text datasets using. 
- Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)
- Structural Topic Models 
- Non-Negative Matrix Factorization (NMF)

# 7. Named Entity Recognition (NER)
- Extract structured entities like names, dates, and locations from text.
- Using pre-trained spaCy models for quick results.
- Training custom NER models using transformer-based architectures.

# 8. Text Summarization
- Extractive Methods: Select key sentences using algorithms like TextRank.
- Abstractive Methods: Generate human-like summaries with transformers like BART and T5.

# 9. Transformer-Based Models for NLP
- Explore state-of-the-art NLP with transformers:
- Understand architectures like BERT, GPT, and RoBERTa.
- Fine-tune pre-trained models for tasks like text classification, text generation, and semantic similarity.
- Utilize Hugging Face Transformers for streamlined implementation.

# 10. Custom NLP Pipelines from Hugging Face Models
