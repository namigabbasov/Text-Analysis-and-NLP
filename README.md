# Text Analysis and NLP Tutorials [ _Additional Materials will be uploaded_]

# Overview
This repository provides step-by-step tutorials on Text Analysis and Natural Language Processing (NLP). It is designed to guide learners and practitioners from foundational concepts to advanced techniques like transformer-based models. Each tutorial includes power point slides, code examples, and practical applications.
